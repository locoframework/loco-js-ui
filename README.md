# üìù UI.Form

This class is useful when you want to allow users of you app to modify model's attributes. In other words, it connects a model instance with a form.
`UI.Form` converts attributes of model's instance to the values of the corresponding form elements. It gives you a front-end validation without an extra effort and it turns standard static form into dynamic, submitted asynchronously one.

In this section I will be using exemplary model from [Loco-JS-Model README](https://github.com/locoframework/loco-js-model).

The following code presents a view with an example of initializing and using the `UI.Form`.

```javascript
// views/admin/coupons/new.js

import { UI, Views } from "loco-js";

import Coupon from "models/Coupon";

class New extends Views.Base {
  static initCoupon(planId) {
    return new Coupon({
      resource: "admin",
      planId,
      amountOff: 0.0,
      percentOff: 0,
      duration: "once"
    });
  }

  constructor(opts) {
    super(opts);
    this.coupon = this.constructor.initCoupon(opts.planId);
  }

  render() {
    const form = new UI.Form({
      for: this.coupon, // (optional) an instance of a model that is connected
                        // with the form
      id: "coupon-form", // (optional) ID attribute of the HTML <form> element.
                         // If not passed - it will be resolved, based on
                         // whether model has ID, to:
                         // * "edit_${lowercased model's identity prop}_${model's ID}"
                         // * "new_${lowercased model's identity prop}"
      initObj: false, // (optional) whether to initialize passed object based
                      // on values of corresponding form's elements.
                      // False by default (it has its initial attribute values)
      delegator: this, // (optional) an object to which all the callbacks
                       // are delegated to
      callbackActive: "callbackActive", // (optional) the name of the function
                                        // that will be called after sending the request
      callbackSuccess: "callbackSuccess", // (optional) the name of the function that
                                          // will be called on success
      callbackFailure: "callbackFailure" // (optional) the name of the function that
                                         // will be called if an object
                                         // is invalid on the front-end
                                         // or back-end side (400 HTTP status code)
    });

    form.render();
  }

  callbackActive() {
    console.log("Coupon is creating on the server...");
  }

  callbackSuccess(data) {
    console.log("Coupon has been created.");
  }

  callbackFailure() {
    console.log("Creation failed or front-end validations didn't pass.");
  }
}
```

From the HTML perspective - the following example shows how a form should be structured.
What you should pay attention to is that all tags related to given attribute, should be wrapped by a tag with a proper **data-attr** attribute. The value of this attribute should match the **remote name** of given attribute (the name of the corresponding attribute on the server side, returned by an API).

Look at how errors are expressed. The tag is irrelevant, only **errors** class and **data-for** HTML attribute are important.

```html
<form id="coupon-form">
  <p data-attr="stripe_id">
    <label>Stripe ID</label><br>
    <input type="text" />
    <span class="errors" data-for="stripe_id"></span>
  </p>

  <p data-attr="amount_off">
    <input type="radio" name="amount_off" value="0" />
    <label>$0 off</label>

    <input type="radio" name="amount_off" value="20" />
    <label>$20 off</label>

    <input type="radio" name="amount_off" value="50" />
    <label>$50 off</label>

    <span class="errors" data-for="amount_off"></span>
  </p>

  <p data-attr="percent_off">
    <input type="hidden" name="percent_off" value="0" />

    <input type="checkbox" name="percent_off" value="50" />
    <label>50% off</label>

    <span class="errors" data-for="percent_off"></span>
  </p>

  <p data-attr="duration">
    <label>Duration</label><br>
    <select>
      <option value="forever">Forever</option>
      <option value="once">Once</option>
      <option value="repeating">Repeating</option>
    </select>
  </p>

  <p data-attr="duration_in_months">
    <label>Duration in months</label><br>
    <input type="text" />
    <span class="errors" data-for="duration_in_months"></span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    <span class="errors" data-for="base"></span>
  </p>
</form>
```

Remember that when you submitting a form, **all model attributes** are sent to the server and not only those available to modify via the form fields.
Model's attribute can be an object as well - for example, if you want to send a nested resources.

If model's ID is `null`, the instance is considered as new, not persisted on the server, so after submitting a form, Loco-JS will send the following XHR request:

```bash
Started POST "/admin/plans/7/coupons"
Parameters: {"coupon"=>{"stripe_id"=>"my-project-test", "percent_off"=>50, "amount_off"=>"0", "duration"=>"repeating", "duration_in_months"=>6, "max_redemptions"=>nil, "redeem_by"=>nil}, "plan_id"=>"7"}
```

On the other hand, if model instance has not null ID, Loco-JS sends the following XHR request to the server.

```bash
Started PUT "/admin/plans/9/coupons/100"
Parameters: {"coupon"=>{"stripe_id"=>"my-project-test", "percent_off"=>0, "amount_off"=>"50", "duration"=>"once", "duration_in_months"=>nil, "max_redemptions"=>nil, "redeem_by"=>nil}, "plan_id"=>"9", "id"=>"100"}
```

The success response from the server should be in the JSON format with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "status": 200,
  "data": {      // (optional) this object that will be passed to
    "id": 123,   // callbackSuccess if this function is defined
    "foo": "bar"
  },
  "flash": {                              // (optional) UI.Form changes the value
    "success": "Coupon has been created!" // of submit button depending on the current
  },                                      // state of the form and this key represents
                                          // the success state (a record has been saved)
  "access_token": "123qweasd" // (optional) when access_token is returned you can then
                              // emit on the server a signal assigned to that token
}
```

The example of the failure response:

```javascript
{
  "success": false,
  "status": 400,
  "errors": {
    "stripe_id": ["has already been taken"],
    "base": ["something wrong with the whole object"]
  }
}
```
